# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width for three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset
- Source: Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, check for missing values, and explore data distribution.
2. **Data Visualization**: Use seaborn and matplotlib for pair plots and correlation analysis.
3. **Model Selection**: Train and evaluate models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and SVM.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict species based on input features.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies using `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells sequentially.
3. View results in graphical and tabular format.

## Results
- The model achieves high accuracy in classifying iris species.
- Visualizations help understand feature importance and data distribution.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with additional classification models.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
